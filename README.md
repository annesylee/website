    I am an MPS (Master in Professional Studies) student at <a href= "https://www.cornell.edu" style= "color:#303c6c"> Cornell University </a> 
    in the department of <a href= "https://infosci.cornell.edu" style= "color:#303c6c"> Information Science</a>.   
    I completed my B.A. in Communication at 
    <a href="https://communication.cals.cornell.edu" style= "color:#303c6c"> Cornell University</a> (2016) and  
    M.A. in Communication at <a href= http://communication.snu.ac.kr/?lang=en style= "color:#303c6c">
    Seoul National University </a> (2019). 
    I worked at Robotics and Media Institute as a researcher at the 
    <a href="https://www.kist.re.kr/rmi/user/main/main" style= "color:#303c6c"> 
    Korea Institute of Science and Technology </a>. 

    <p> 
    My research interests are in human-computer interaction (HCI), Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), 
    and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Especially, I am interested in solving diverse social phenomena 
    such as privacy, bias, online segregation, and miscommunication with new technologies in various contexts. 
    Also, I am interested in analyzing and observing interactive and affective interactions 
    between users and diverse media platforms. 
    </p> 

    <p> 
    I enjoy nature because it would give time for pondering myself and a chance to relax.
    My favorite place is the crystal-blue sea with clear water and sand.
