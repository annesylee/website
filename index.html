    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Hi, my name is Anne Seoyoung Lee. I am an MPS student at [Cornell University in the 
      Department of Information Science](https://infosci.cornell.edu/). I completed my B.A. 
      in [Communication at Cornell University](https://communication.cals.cornell.edu/) (2016) 
      and M.A. in [Communication at Seoul National University](http://communication.snu.ac.kr/?lang=en) (2019). 
      I worked at Robotics and Media Institute as a researcher at [Korea 
      Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.kist.re.kr/rmi/user/main/main).
      
      I believe that design is the <strong> interplay between technology and psychology. </strong> In particular, understanding people
      is the key to making designs useful and practical. I strongly believe that <strong> human centered and user oriented
      designs</strong> are essential factors for positive and sustainable interactions to produce pleasurable experiences for 
      users. 
      
      I am mainly interested in examining the User Experience with diverse forms of media depending on <strong> individual 
      psychological and physiological characteristics, </strong> such as personality, information processing style, anxiety level,
      and emotion. In addition, I am inteterested in anlyzing user experiences depending on different <strong> demographic and 
      background information,</strong> such as age, culture, and information literacy. I would also like to conduct 
      <strong> inclusive design research </strong> targeting the aging generation and people with disabilities. 
      
      Please download my <strong><a href= "RESUME.pdf"> CV </a></strong> here.
